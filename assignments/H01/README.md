## Abstraction

The act of hiding the more complex details in a program. Preferably through a class.

## Attributes / Properties

Attributes denote a part of an aggregate object, while Properties cover the characteristics of a class.

## Class

The foundation of objects that contain the primary values and implementations of behaviour. Keyword

## Class Variable

Variables that are declared with the static modifier of which a single copy exists regardless of the number of instances that exist within the class.

## Composition

Description of a class that references one or more objects from other classes in instance variables.

## Encapsulation

The act of binding a couple of data, concepts and functions into a singular unit.

## Friends

A function that is given the same access as methods to private and protected data. Keyword friend.

## Inheritance

When a Child Class inherits functions and variables from a Parent Class. Mostly done through a virtual function. Keyword

## Instance Variable

Variables defined in a class, for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance.

## Member Variable

A variable that is associated with a specific object, which can be accessed by all of it's methods.

## Method

The behavior of the objects created in the class.

## Multiple Inheritance

Objects inheriting from more than one Parent object/class.

## Object

A customized variable that is created through a class.

## Overloading

Calling a function with the same name, but different parameters. i.e Calling int add(int, int), and int add(double, double)

## Polymorphism

The ability to process objects differently depending on the data type or class.

## Public

Functions/Variables that can be accessed by anyone. 

## Private

Functions/Variables that can only be accessed through Public Functions. 

## Protected

Functions/Variables that can only be accessed by the original class and Friends.

## Virtual

Function or method whose behavior can be overridden within an inherited class by a function with the same signature. Keyword
